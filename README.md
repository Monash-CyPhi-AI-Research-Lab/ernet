# ERNet: An Efficient and Reliable Human-Object Interaction Detection Network

In this repo, we implement ERNet, an end-to-end trainable convolutional-transformer network for efficient and reliable HOI detection. The code will be released upon manuscript acceptance to IEEE Transctions on Image Processing.
